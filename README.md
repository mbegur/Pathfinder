[Live Link](https://mbegur.github.io/Pathsolver/)

## Introduction
The aim of this project was to visualize how different pathing algorithms find the nearest path between two points. PathSolver allows users to build their own obstacles/mazes to effectively show A\*, Breadth-First-Search, and Dijkstra's algorithms execute.

In four days this project was built with the following technologies:
- Vanilla Javascript
- jQuery
- EaselJS
